# project-management-system
Developed a management system using Node.js and React, featuring an admin portal for managing projects, users, and CMS pages. Implemented basic authentication using a JWT token system in Node.js. The frontend includes a simple header, footer, and CMS pages, with project data fetched via Axios from Node.js APIs.
